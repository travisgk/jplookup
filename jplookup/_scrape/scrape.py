Description: This file defines the primary function that scrapes
             information about a Japanese term from its English Wiktionary
             page and returns it in an easy-to-read format for the user.

             The idea is to give back the information on the main Wiktionary
             page while also incorporating the relevant Etymologies referred
             to on separate Wiktionary pages.

    """
    Scrapes a Wiktionary entry for Japanese word information,
    returning a list which includes pronunciations and definitions,
    with definitions having any example sentences added.
    This will be a list of dictionaries.

    None is returned if no results could be found.

    The first dictionary of the returned results will contain
    the primary

    Any pages that are redirected to (i.e. alternative spelling) will
    be scraped as well, however, only information relevant to the original
    searched term will be taken and then appended to the root page's data.
    For example:
        - term = "はく":
            This will grab the definitions of ALL words with kanji spellings,
            where for each kanji spelling its Wiktionary page
            is scraped recursively, however, only etymologies
            with pronunciations of "はく" under these child Wiktionary pages
            will have their definitions taken and added to the data of the
            original scrape(...) call.

        - term = "捕る"
            This Wiktionary page indicates that "捕る"
            is an alternative spelling of "はく", providing a redirect to the
            Wiktionary page for "はく". In this case, the "はく" page is scraped,
            however, only definitions that are specified as fitting
            with the contextual spelling ("捕る") or have no specified
            fitting contextual spellings at all will be taken
            and added to the data of the original scrape(...) call.

        - term = "取る"
            This Wiktionary page indicates that "取る"
            is an alternative spelling of "はく", providing a redirect to the
            Wiktionary page for "はく". In this case, the "はく" page is scraped,
            however, only definitions that are specified as fitting
            with the contextual spelling ("取る") or have no specified
            fitting contextual spellings at all will be taken
            and added to the data of the original scrape(...) call.

    Parameters:
        term (str): the Japanese word to search.
        depth (int): the recursive depth.
        original_term (str): used for recursive calls; holds the original term
                             searched when <term> is being used
                             for an alternative spelling.
        re_sleep_seconds: the duration in seconds that the program
                          will sleep before scraping a child Wiktionary page.
        error_sleep_seconds: the duration in seconds that the program
                             will sleep if it gets a 404.
        force_sleep (bool): if True, the program sleeps for <re_sleep_seconds>
                            regardless of the current recursive depth.
        verbose (bool): if False, the script won't print any error messages.
